# sudokunix
Sudoku implemented using Go and GTK3 (gotk3)

This is my first Go project since I started learning Go on Udemy.

Fully functional with a few visual glitches.

To do: 
- Fix glitches when adding candidates.
- Tidy up code

# Install and Run (Ubuntu):

- sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libglib2.0-dev -y

- cd src

- go run cmd/sudokunix/main.go
